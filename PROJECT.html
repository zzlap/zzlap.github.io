        <h5>TRANSITION PROCESS</h5>
        <p>The transition is happening in communication and information flow provided by social medias</p>
        <h5>EXPLANATION</h5>
        <P>Social medias are changing the way we 
            communicate, the way information is spread around, provided new work opportunities as well as new ways for new communities to form, had a huge impact on peoples personal lives. It had both a good and a bad influence on people. But the main thing social medias are made for is for people to 
            communicate, moving more of peoples’ communication towards digital spaces. My project will help utilise social medias positively, minimalising the harm and making the community as best as it can possibly be.</P>
        <h5>PROJECT IDEA ( long but interesting text ):</h5>
        <p>10 posters regarding the effects of social media on people as a 
            community and as individuals in addition it will explain how to make use of abilities provided by social media. I chose the number ten because I was inspired by religion ,,The ten God’s commandments” I chose them because I think social media has become in a way a religion of its’ own because of the importance and influence it has on todays world. In middle ages religion was the main thing in everyones lives it dictated  such things as a way of living, personal values, perception of others and even fashion trends. Social media has simillar effects in thodays world. In order to guide the social media community in a more possitive way the posters will be educational such as ,,The ten God’s commandments”, though they will expand more on the information. There would be an event formed to popularise these posters. This event would be a treasure hunt popularised by social medias, at a random time not known to people the 3 posters would be placed in a city and people who find it, need to take a selfie and post it on their story tagging a certain 
            instagram account. First 300 people that post a selfie on their story would be in a giveaway of t-shirts whom designs would be made similar to posters. There would be only 3 to 9 t-shirts given out in order to make them limited edition so that hype about them would be formed, maybe even asking for some designers with well know names to collaborate for more exclusiveness and excitement to be risen on finding these posters.  T-shirts not only would make this competition popular but it would provide for more long term advertising of this project. For example, if people would like the designs the t-shirts would be a reminder of this event, a conversation starter so the word about these poster would be spread even after the event.</p>
         <h5>POSTERS AND T-SHIRTS:</h5>

         <h3>ADDICTION</h3>
            <img src="poster/add.png" class="Post" >
            <img src="poster/addiction.png" class="Post" >
         <!--<div class="TONBUT">
            <image src="merch/BUT.png" class="but"></image>

         </div>-->
         <image src="MERCH/ADDICTION MMM.png"class="merch" ></image>
         <div>
         <p>Social medias are made in a way that they would be addictive so that more people would use them for longer amounts of time. For example the scrolling motion in social medias is simillar to casino arcade games also content is really fast pace. It is needed especially for young people to understand that the time on social medias should be controlled. The design is showing an addict who is using his phone even at night and the other side is made inspired by cigarette packets.</p>
         </div>

          <div class="tencommandments">
         <h3>INFORMATION FLOW</h3>
         <image src="POSTER/Artboard 1.png"class="Post"></image>
         <image src="POSTER/Artboard 1 copy.png"class="Post"></image>
         <image src="MERCH/INFORMATION FLOW MERCH.png" class="merch"></image>
         <p>There is a vast amount of information on social medias seen by everyone, there could not be as much information before social medias as it is now. It is easy for a person to be overflown by this amount of information. In addition, it should be mentioned for young people to avoid believing information on social media due to a lot of fake news and propoganda. By making the design really messy and noisy I am trying to replicate a persons feelings when he is reading a lot of varying information.</p> 
      </div>

      <div class="tencommandments">
         <h3>LOW CONFIDENCE</h3>
         <image src="POSTER/DONT FEEL LIKE GOING OUT 1.png"class="Post"></image>
         <image src="POSTER/DONT FEEL LIKE GOING OUT 2.png"class="Post"></image>
         <image src="MERCH/Artboard 1.png" class="merch"></image>
         <p>On social medias all sorts of talented, exceptional people are brought to light, so when scrolling social medias they are seen more than ordinary people. It can make you think that you are unsuccesful making a person lose confidence. Furthermore, it is also important while talking about body standards. Social media has a huge influence on body image of most people, because of that, there are standards for how slim your waist should be, how much muscle should you have or what percent of your body is fat. It is needed to understand that all bodies are good if you are healthy and it should not determine your well being. The brushstrokes on bodies of those two humans are symbolising the itch to hide 
            ourselves from others when we are not feeling confident.</p>
         </div>

         <div class="tencommandments">
         <h3>VISIBILITTY</h3>
         <image src="POSTER/only.png"class="Post"></image>
         <image src="POSTER/costs.png"class="Post"></image>
         <image src="MERCH/COSTS.png" class="merch"></image>
         <p>Social media provide people with the ability to get visibility it only costs a log in to it. Everyone has the tools to get fame much easier than ever before, while using social medias and making content, your opinion or work could be seen. For example such careers as an artist are now more prosperous. I chose the megaphone because it symbolises a tool which helps you become heard.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="tencommandments">
         <h3>FAKENESS</h3>
         <image src="POSTER/do not.png"class="Post"></image>
         <image src="POSTER/eat this candy.png"class="Post"></image>
         <image src="MERCH/CANDY MERCH.png" class="merch"></image>
         <p>This poster is showing that a lot of people on social medias are fake so even while chating on medias you need to be aware of catfishing. The first page is symbolising that looks are not everything.  Humans on social media show mostly their good side hiding their bad side. By this design the candy with a skull on it is a metaphore to some people on social media, meaning that they could look one way but act the other.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="tencommandments">
         <h3>FASHION</h3>
         <image src="POSTER/fash.png"class="Post"></image>
         <image src="POSTER/fashion.png"class="Post"></image>
         <image src="MERCH/FASHION MERCH.png" class="merch"></image>
         <p>Fashion has become very fast pace, the trends are short and there is a lot of them, social medias has contributed to this problem a lot. Because of social medias spread of information there a lot of short trends happening between young people. Consequently, it makes people look almost identical, 
            diminishing their uniqueness also it is not bio friendly because there is a high consumption of cheap clothes, which are thrown out after short periods of time. People should reuse, reconstruct or remake the clothes that you are ot wearing anymore. In this design I show the vast amount of  trends by 
            marking them on calendars.</p>
         </div>

         <div class="tencommandments"  >
         <h3>SUPPORT AND HATE</h3>
         <image src="POSTER/is a tool.png"class="Post"></image>
         <image src="POSTER/social media.png"class="Post"></image>
         <image src="MERCH/shoot.png" class="merch"></image>
         <p>The social media has  a lot of people who either hate or support you though the hatefull people are really brutal, because of that many people on social medias get a lot of hate, much more than they get compliments. People in real life and on social media would equally compliment and support you but those who do not like you would be ruthless on social media compared to real life.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="tencommandments">
         <h3>GOOD AND BAD INFLUENCES</h3>
         <image src="POSTER/WOW.png"class="Post"></image>
         <image src="POSTER/OWO.png"class="Post"></image>
         <image src="MERCH/CRAZY.png" class="merch"></image>
         <p>There are a lot of famous people that are of big influence to people, but it does not mean those ideals are not allways good natured. People need to understand that famous people should not be allways trusted.  Most of the famous people are on social medias and have an influence there. On this design a distorted image of a popular celebrity is shown in order to show that the outside view of them could be totally manipulated by them.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="tencommandments">
         <h3>LOW ATTENTION SPAN</h3>
         <image src="POSTER/read.png"class="Post"></image>
         <image src="POSTER/Short.png"class="Post"></image>
         <image src="MERCH/read me.png" class="merch"></image>
         <p>First page is specialy made to prove a person that he does not have the attention span to read it all so if he would skip to the end he would find a message ,,Congratulations you have no attention span you skipped to the end so skip to the other side.” It provides the information about how information on  social medias affect peoples attention span and how to prevent that from happening.  This results in a lack of concentration on daily tasks, while working or studying. With my design im trying to prove for readers that they do not have patience to read all of this thus most of the time proving what I am 
            writing.</p>
         </div>

         <div class="tencommandments">
         <h3>IDENTITY CRISIS</h3>
         <image src="POSTER/WHO.png"class="Post"></image>
         <image src="POSTER/THE HELL AM I.png" class="Post"></image>
         <image src="MERCH/Identity crysis.png" class="merch"></image>
         <p>Due to a lot of different trends, opinions, views of life presented on social medias there are a lot of 
            confused people about their being. It results in an identity crisis when a person listens to many 
            different opinions tries to fit everywhere and does not form his own personality. In this design I express this by making a being formed from many animals.</p>
         </div>

        
         <h5>EXTENSION ON WEB</h5>

         <h3>WHAT WILL BE ON THIS EXTENSION</h5>
         <p>To access it you need to scan a QR-code on the posters. This extension will include a virtual version of these posters with additional interactive features(such as some interactive poster design parts, rotating posters, the abilitty to burn the poster or else) also it will contain information written by professional psychologists, an interview of a famous person if there would be the ability to get one and the designers 
            personal opinion summarised.</p>
         <h3>HOW THE WEB EXTENSION WOULD LOOK:</h5>
         <h4>IPHONE 8 size</h4>
         <image src="1x/IPHONE SMALL.png" class="iphones"></image>
         <h4>IPAD PRO size</h4>
         <image src="1x/IPHONE BIG.png" class="iphones"></image>
         <h5>CONCLUSION</h5>
         <p>I as a designer will accompany the change of 
            communication moving from real life to virtual. My addition to this transition would be teaching people to utilise social medias to it’s full potential and prevent the negative effects of social media from happening to people. The posters would be brought to public by an event aimed at the younger 
            audience, but it can be enjoyed by all ages.</p>
